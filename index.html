    <h3>Question2</h3>
    <pre style="font-size: x-large;">
    Inline CSS: Inline CSS is used to style a specific HTML element. For this we have to add the
    style attribute to the starting HTML tag, without using selectors.
    </pre>
    <pre style="font-size: x-large;">
    Internal CSS:we have to add a style tag in the head section of our HTML document.
    Using this style for multiple pages is time-consuming as we have to put CSS rules on every page of our website. 
    Direction to use internal CSS: 
     1.Open HTML page and locate head opening tag. 
     2.Create style tag inside head tag
     3. Put the CSS styling code in that style tag </pre>
    <pre style="font-size: x-large;">
    External CSS:With external CSS, we link our web pages to an external .css file.
    This CSS type is a more efficient method.
    
  Directions to use external CSS:
    
   1. Create a new .css file and add the style rules. 
   2. In the head section of HTML sheet, add a reference of external .css file after title tag:
  
Advantages of External CSS:
External CSS code is in a separate document, HTML files will have a cleaner structure.
We can use the same .css file for multiple pages.

Disadvantages of External CSS:
Pages may not be rendered correctly until the external CSS is loaded.
Uploading or linking to multiple CSS files can increase your site’s download time.
